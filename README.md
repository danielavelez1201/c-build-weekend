# Corkboard
OnDeck Catalyst Build Weekend- Daniela Velez, Jacky Huang, Ivan Zhao, Vidit Goyal, Kelvin Yu, Khushi Shelat

## Corkboard is a board for all the pins, files, and browser windows you need for each ongoing workstream, visually organized. 

Imagine Notion meets whiteboarding. You can pin and move around relevant resource modals, such as a Notion Doc, Figma file, Jira task list, Slack channel, or links, and add annotations and sticky notes to make your board your own. So you can understand your workstream status at a glance, Corkboard also generates doc summaries and highlights the latest resource updates on each modal, such as the latest changes made on a Notion doc. No more need to have all your workstream resources scattered across 50 browser windows and apps - now theyâ€™re all in one corkboard.
